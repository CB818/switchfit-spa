### THIS IS THE PLANNER. It can be quite confusing because it used to be the dashboard.
I tried to rename it from dashboard to planner, but it did not work directly. I did not want
to waste more time on that as this as it is will not be used in the future.

'use strict'

angular.module('switchfitApp')
  .service 'Dashboard', ->
    # AngularJS will instantiate a singleton by calling "new" on this function
